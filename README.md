### Tool Stack

- <u>ViteJS:</u><br/>

  Choose Vite over Create-React-App due to it being far more minimalistic, faster and providing a higher degree of flexibility in configuration. Pondered starting from scratch with ESBuild but the amount of up front configuration was considered enough for learning.

- <u>Prettier:</u><br/>

  Consistent formatting.

- <u>ESLint:</u><br/>

  Only using ESLint for correctness checking, no style enforcments.

- <u>Vitest:</u><br/>

  Vitest was chosen over Jest for greater compatability towards ViteJS.

- <u>GitHub Actions</u><br/>

  Small steps for learing CI/CD
