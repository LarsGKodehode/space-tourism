### Tech Stack

- <u>React</u><br/>
  React is currently the most used framework for developing application style web pages. This page is rather static though so could have gone with one of the lighter alternatives.
  - <u>React Router</u><br/>
  Starting of without a backend and needed some form for routing. React Router was the most used library for providing that functionality to the page.
  - <u>Zustand</u><br/>
  Only incorporated becuse I need some more experience working with some kind of 'global' state.
- <u>Tailwind</u><br/>
  This is a solo project. Tailwind CSS allows me to focus more on the funcitonal sides of the page without having to expend enough time to reinvent the wheel.

### Tool Stack

- <u>ViteJS:</u><br/>

  I choose Vite over Create-React-App due to it being far more minimalistic, faster and providing a higher degree of flexibility in configuration. I pondered starting from scratch with ESBuild but the amount of up front configuration was considered enough for learning.

- <u>Prettier:</u><br/>

  Consistent formatting.

- <u>ESLint:</u><br/>

  Only using ESLint for correctness checking, no style enforcments.

- <u>Vitest:</u><br/>

  Vitest was chosen over Jest for greater compatability towards ViteJS.

- <u>GitHub Actions</u><br/>

  Small steps for learing CI/CD
